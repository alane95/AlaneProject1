# Connect Four

Overview: Connect FOur is a tic-tac-toe like game and it is play with two playwers with colored discs. where the players alternate places to form a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line on a board of seven columns across and six rows high. I pick this game because I want to see how I ccan code the game concept in javascript. Would it be similar to how a tic-tac-toe game? what would be different? Also, I really think I can learn a lot in term of css and javascript building a connect four. 

Game rule:The game will be played from the bottom row to the top rows. the players will do so by playing one row at the time, when there's only one spot left to fill players can move on to the next row. The players must connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row to win. Only one piece is played at a time. Players can be on the offensive or defensive. The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a there's a draw.

WireFrame: the wireframe is under screenshot. 


User stories: To start the game the player will need to press the start button. Since the player will be playing agaist the computer, the computer will go first. After a player win the game or reach a draw, player can press the reset button to reset the game. The winner of the game will be announce under status. In other to play the game all players have to do is press one of the circle on the board. The game can be play from left to right from the bottom up. 

MVP checklist: The game will have a start and reset button, which will be at the bottom of the board. On the left side of the board there will be a status and the colors of the circle and right next to the color the winner will be announce. There will be form box, for user to input there names.

Stretch goals: I would love to have two different 2 diiferent players instead of playing against the computer. I want to have two different pages, where one would be the user input and the title of the game. If I succeed in doing the two players I want them to have a choice to choose the color disc they want.
